# Automatic-Number-plate-Detection

Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR):

Number Plate recognition, also called License Plate realization or recognition using image processing methods is a potential research area in smart cities and the Internet of Things. An exponential increase in the number of vehicles necessitates the use of automated systems to maintain vehicle information for various purposes.

This project uses deep learning to detect and recognize number plates from vehicle images. The goal is to build a model that can accurately detect the number plate, even under challenging conditions such as different lighting conditions and angles.
